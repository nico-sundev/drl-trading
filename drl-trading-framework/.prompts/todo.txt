todo features:
- control import strategy through application config
    - add string property "strategy" to LocalDataImportConfig class
    - instantiate preferred import strategy extending BaseDataImportService dynamically based on the config property "strategy" using a factory pattern
    - update containers.py so factory class is creating import strategy class and include in DI
- normalize features before training
    - call vecnormalize before training starts
    - investigate which scope it belongs to at the best
- optimize training multiple environments concurrently
    - check if whether dummyvecenv or subprocvecenv is better for training performance in class AgentTrainingService

next sprint:
- model save checkpoints
- integrate backtrader
- MLFlow integration -> investigate gitlab model -> configure to use local service
- research for SBX for faster training
- implement data provider APIs
    - binance
    - twelvedata
    - implement dataset catchup module
- create GNN -> see all_in_one.py -> start with: Which data to we need and how do we have to preprocess
