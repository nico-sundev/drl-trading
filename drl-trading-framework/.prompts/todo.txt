todo features:
- normalize features before training
    - call vecnormalize before training starts
    - investigate which scope it belongs to at the best
- optimize training multiple environments concurrently
    - check if whether dummyvecenv or subprocvecenv is better for training performance in class AgentTrainingService

next sprint:
- model save checkpoints
- MLFlow integration -> investigate gitlab model -> configure to use local service
- research for SBX for faster training
- implement data provider APIs
    - binance
    - twelvedata
    - implement dataset catchup module
- create GNN -> see all_in_one.py -> start with: Which data to we need and how do we have to preprocess
