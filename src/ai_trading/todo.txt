general development advice/rules:
- Whole src/ path to follow SOLID principles
- always take into account ApplicationConfig class and all classes recursively referenced, before planning changes -> also see applicationConfig.json and its test implementation applicationConfig-test.json
- Always try to keep architecture well designed, be dynamic everywhere possible, try to abstract things if makes sense
- Write comments
- unit tests below tests/unit/ directory
- IT below tests/it/ directory
- every testfile postfixed "_test" instead of prefixed
- always use pytest
- create a fixture where possible and senseful
- if possible, structure every test method in # Given ... # When ... # Then sections
