todo features:
- normalize features before training
    - add normalization_method enum to baseparametersetconfig, e.g.: NONE, ATR
        - add a normalization step somewhere in between the process
    - call vecnormalize before training starts
    - investigate which scope it belongs to at the best
- optimize training multiple environments concurrently in training service
    - check if whether dummyvecenv or subprocvecenv is better for training performance in class AgentTrainingService

backlog:
- impl opentelemetry, jaeger, grafana
- research for SBX for faster training in strategy project
- implement data provider APIs for ingest service
    - binance
    - twelvedata
    - implement dataset catchup module
- pattern recognition for enhanced observation space: create GNN -> see all_in_one.py -> start with: Which data to we need and how do we have to preprocess
