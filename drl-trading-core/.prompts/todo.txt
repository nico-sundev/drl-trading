todo features:
- cleanup tests/*/conftest.py
- normalize features before training
    - add normalization_method enum to baseparametersetconfig, e.g.: NONE, ATR
        - add a normalization step somewhere in between the process
    - call vecnormalize before training starts
    - investigate which scope it belongs to at the best
- optimize training multiple environments concurrently
    - check if whether dummyvecenv or subprocvecenv is better for training performance in class AgentTrainingService

next sprint:
- impl opentelemetry, jaeger, grafana
- model save checkpoints
- MLFlow integration -> investigate gitlab model -> configure to use local service
- research for SBX for faster training
- implement data provider APIs
    - binance
    - twelvedata
    - implement dataset catchup module
- create GNN -> see all_in_one.py -> start with: Which data to we need and how do we have to preprocess
- introduce enum for data import strategy
    - refactor implementations like csv import
    - refactor config files
