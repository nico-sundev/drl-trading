Do a final review of your recent changes. Consider those files, which got updated in this session.
- Is the code well structured?
- Is the integration of the code into the existing codebase appropriate, does it really solve the original problem now?
- Do we comply with our logging standards?
- What do we log, what might be missing?
- What about type hints?
- Are the comments on point and least-verbose?

If your assessment does not identify any significant changes, then we can proceed without any updates.
Do the best, you can, then we are going to test our changes.
