Appreciate it.
Now i want you to do a final review of your recent changes. Consider those files, which appear to be changed in your last episode.
- Did we embrace any new patterns or best practices?
- Should we document these changes or the reasoning behind them?
- Should we update any README.md file (**ONLY** for super important changes affecting the development process, architecture, usage etc.)?
- Could we add value to our [.github/instructions](../instructions/), for future agentic AI usage?

If your assessment does not identify any significant changes, then we can proceed without updating the documentation.
