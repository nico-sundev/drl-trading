# 🚀 Task: Migrate PyScaffold Project to Use UV as Package Manager

## 📌 Objective

Migrate the existing Python project (scaffolded with **PyScaffold**) to use **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** as the primary package manager. Ensure that the migration does **not refactor any core functionality or package structure** generated by PyScaffold.

This migration is meant to modernize the development workflow, improve reproducibility, and simplify dependency management.

## ✅ Requirements

### 1. 🔁 Replace Dependency Management

- Use `uv` for:
    - Creating the virtual environment
    - Managing dependencies
    - Installing the project in editable mode

### 2. 📁 Create Project Lockfile

- Generate a `uv.lock` file using `uv pip compile` to lock dependencies.
- Ensure it is tracked in `.gitignore` only **if** that's the team's convention. Otherwise, **include it in version control** for reproducibility.

### 3. 🛠 Update Developer Tooling

- Update any dev README or internal instructions to reflect:
  ```bash
  uv venv
  uv pip install -e .
  uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # if applicable
