# Current Focus

## Active Work: Week of July 19, 2025

### Primary Focus
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Feature Pipeline Infrastructure epic - Feast integration 100% complete
- 🔄 **ACTIVE:** MLflow Model Management Integration epic
- Setup foundational ML lifecycle management
- Prepare for Microservice Integration Pipeline epic

### Next Up (Priority Order)
1. [ ] `mlflow-integration/001-gitlab-mlflow-setup.md` - Setup GitLab MLflow hosting
2. [ ] `ml-pipeline-enhancement/001-feature-normalization.md` - Feature normalization system
3. [ ] `data-infrastructure-expansion/001-binance-data-provider.md` - Binance API integration
4. [ ] `microservice-integration/001-preprocessing-service-setup.md` - Setup preprocessing service
5. [ ] `observability-monitoring/001-opentelemetry-setup.md` - Monitoring infrastructure

### Currently Working On
- [ ] `mlflow-integration/001-gitlab-mlflow-setup.md` - Begin MLflow integration setup
- [ ] Research GitLab MLflow hosting requirements and configuration
- [ ] Design model versioning strategy with FeatureConfigVersionInfo integration

### Recently Completed
- ✅ **Feature Pipeline Infrastructure Epic - COMPLETE**
  - ✅ Feast save/fetch repositories with full offline/online integration
  - ✅ Local Parquet and S3 backend storage implementations
  - ✅ FeatureStoreWrapper with path resolution and caching
  - ✅ FeastProvider with complete dependency injection support
  - ✅ Comprehensive unit and integration testing suite
  - ✅ Production-ready implementation with error handling
  - ✅ Full SOLID compliance and clean architecture

### Blocked/Waiting
- **Training Service Integration** blocked until MLflow epic complete
- **Inference Service Integration** blocked until MLflow epic complete
- Microservice integration tickets can proceed in parallel with MLflow development

### Notes & Context
- ✅ **Feature Pipeline Infrastructure COMPLETE** - Feast implementation production-ready
- **FOCUS SHIFT: MLflow Integration** - Next major milestone for ML lifecycle management
- Architecture documentation critical for AI agent context and team understanding
- E2E diagram will clarify service interactions and help validate design
- **ML Pipeline Enhancement** can start in parallel with MLflow integration
- **Data Infrastructure** critical for production readiness
- **Major Milestone Achieved:** Core feature storage infrastructure complete
