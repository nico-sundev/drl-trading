# Current Focus

## Active Work: Week of July 19, 2025

### Primary Focus
- Complete Feature Pipeline Infrastructure epic
- Begin MLflow Model Management Integration epic
- Setup foundational ML lifecycle management
- Prepare for Microservice Integration Pipeline epic

### Next Up (Priority Order)
1. [ ] `feast-implementation/004-online-store.md` - Online store integration
2. [ ] `feast-implementation/005-s3-backend.md` - S3 backend implementation
3. [ ] `mlflow-integration/001-gitlab-mlflow-setup.md` - Setup GitLab MLflow hosting
4. [ ] `mlflow-integration/002-core-mlflow-integration.md` - Core framework integration
5. [ ] `microservice-integration/001-preprocessing-service-setup.md` - Setup preprocessing service

### Currently Working On
- [ ] _Add current ticket here when you start working_

### Blocked/Waiting
- **Training Service Integration** blocked until MLflow epic complete
- **Inference Service Integration** blocked until MLflow epic complete
- Microservice integration tickets depend on both Feature Pipeline + MLflow completion

### Notes & Context
- Feature Pipeline Infrastructure must complete before microservice integration
- Architecture documentation critical for AI agent context and team understanding
- E2E diagram will clarify service interactions and help validate design
- Preprocessing service is key bottleneck - prioritize setup and feature integration
