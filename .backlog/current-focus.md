# Current Focus

## Active Work: Week of August 9, 2025

### Primary Focus
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Feature Pipeline Infrastructure epic - Feast integration 100% complete
- 🔄 **ACTIVE:** Service Standardization & Configuration Architecture epic
- 📝 **CURRENT TASK:** Documenting T005 Logging Configuration Standardization
- Implementing unified logging patterns across all microservices

### Next Up (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Complete T005 implementation - ServiceLogger framework development
2. [ ] `mlflow-integration/001-gitlab-mlflow-setup.md` - Setup GitLab MLflow hosting
3. [ ] `ml-pipeline-enhancement/001-feature-normalization.md` - Feature normalization system
4. [ ] `data-infrastructure-expansion/001-binance-data-provider.md` - Binance API integration
5. [ ] `microservice-integration/001-preprocessing-service-setup.md` - Setup preprocessing service

### Currently Working On
- 🔄 **T005: Logging Configuration Standardization** - README.md documentation
- Designing ServiceLogger framework for unified logging across all services
- Implementing structured JSON logging for production environments
- Creating correlation ID and request context tracking system
- Planning migration strategy for existing services

### Recently Completed
- ✅ **Feature Pipeline Infrastructure Epic - COMPLETE**
  - ✅ Feast save/fetch repositories with full offline/online integration
  - ✅ Local Parquet and S3 backend storage implementations
  - ✅ FeatureStoreWrapper with path resolution and caching
  - ✅ FeastProvider with complete dependency injection support
  - ✅ Comprehensive unit and integration testing suite
  - ✅ Production-ready implementation with error handling
  - ✅ Full SOLID compliance and clean architecture

### Service Standardization Epic Progress
- 📝 **T005: Logging Standardization** - In Progress (Documentation phase)
  - ServiceLogger framework design complete
  - Structured logging with JSON formatting for production
  - Context tracking (correlation ID, request ID) designed
  - Migration strategy planned for all services
- ⏳ **Pending:** T001-T004 (Configuration, Bootstrap, Sensitive Data)
- ⏳ **Pending:** T006-T008 (Migration, Documentation, ADR System)

### Blocked/Waiting
- **MLflow Integration** - Can start in parallel after T005 completion
- **Training Service Integration** - Blocked until service standardization patterns established
- **Inference Service Integration** - Blocked until service standardization patterns established

### Notes & Context
- ✅ **Feature Pipeline Infrastructure COMPLETE** - Feast implementation production-ready
- 🔄 **FOCUS SHIFT: Service Standardization** - Critical foundation for all future development
- **T005 Priority:** Logging standardization essential for production observability
- **Architecture Consistency:** Establishing patterns that will serve as foundation for team scaling
- **Documentation Focus:** Ensuring AI agents and developers have clear architectural context
- **Production Readiness:** JSON logging, correlation tracking, error monitoring integration

## Completed This Week
- ✅ **Feature Pipeline Infrastructure Epic** - Complete Feast integration implementation
  - All repositories, providers, and storage backends implemented
  - Comprehensive testing suite with unit and integration tests
  - Production-ready with full error handling and validation
  - Clean architecture following SOLID principles
  - Ready for MLflow integration and real-time inference

## Current Task Details
**T005 Logging Standardization:**
- Designing ServiceLogger framework for consistent logging across all microservices
- Implementing structured JSON logging for production observability
- Creating correlation ID and request context tracking for distributed tracing
- Planning migration strategy to maintain zero downtime and information loss
- Focus on production-ready features: log rotation, sampling
