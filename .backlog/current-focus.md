# Current Focus

## Active Work: Week of July 19, 2025

### Primary Focus
- 🔄 **FINISHING:** Feature Pipeline Infrastructure epic (Integration tests debugging)
- Begin MLflow Model Management Integration epic
- Setup foundational ML lifecycle management
- Prepare for Microservice Integration Pipeline epic

### Next Up (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Fix Feast integration tests - fixture setup and conftest dependencies
2. [ ] `mlflow-integration/001-gitlab-mlflow-setup.md` - Setup GitLab MLflow hosting
3. [ ] `ml-pipeline-enhancement/001-feature-normalization.md` - Feature normalization system
4. [ ] `data-infrastructure-expansion/001-binance-data-provider.md` - Binance API integration
5. [ ] `microservice-integration/001-preprocessing-service-setup.md` - Setup preprocessing service

### Currently Working On
- [ ] Debug `feast_integration_test.py` and `feature_store_repositories_integration_test.py`
- [ ] Fix missing conftest dependencies and test fixtures
- [ ] Resolve integration container DI setup

### Recently Completed
- ✅ **Core Feast Implementation** - 95% complete
  - Feast save/fetch repositories
  - Local Parquet and S3 backend storage
  - Online/offline feature store integration
  - Comprehensive unit testing
  - **Remaining:** Integration test debugging

### Currently Working On
- [ ] _Add current ticket here when you start working_

### Blocked/Waiting
- **Training Service Integration** blocked until MLflow epic complete
- **Inference Service Integration** blocked until MLflow epic complete
- Microservice integration tickets depend on MLflow completion (Feature Pipeline 95% DONE - just integration tests)

### Notes & Context
- 🔄 **Feature Pipeline Infrastructure 95% COMPLETE** - Core Feast ready, integration tests need debugging
- **NEW: 4 Additional Epics Created** from legacy todo analysis
- Architecture documentation critical for AI agent context and team understanding
- E2E diagram will clarify service interactions and help validate design
- **ML Pipeline Enhancement** can start in parallel with MLflow integration
- **Data Infrastructure** critical for production readiness
