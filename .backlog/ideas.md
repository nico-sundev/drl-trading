# Ideas & Brain Dump

## Quick Thoughts
<!-- Dump ideas here quickly, organize later -->

- preprocessing IT is almost passing ... check if features really have to be passes to the adapter and
  - if so, then create a response object from featuremanager, adding the features
- drltradingadapter contains both test and tests directories
- featureversioninfoconfig use list[featuredefinition] instead of list[dict]
- archunit with hexagonal tests
- circuit breakers

## Future Epics (Unrefined)

- Performance optimization epic
- FTMO compliance validation
- Monitoring and observability
- Auto-scaling microservices

## Technical Debt

- rename infrastructure to application
- cleanup common package
  - move strong business related to core
  - move adapter related to adapter

## Random Notes
<!-- Anything that doesn't fit elsewhere -->
